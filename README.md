Recent MSc graduate in Computer Science, specializing in Software Engineering and backend development, with expertise in several areas of Computer Science.

During my time at the LASIGE Research Unit, I developed a compile-time deadlock detection mechanism for FreeST, which is a functional programming language focused on message-passing communication between concurrent programs via typed channels. 

The developments were iterative, and the first functional version, focused on the monomorphic and non-recursive segment of FreeST, was the subject of an article that I wrote (as the lead author) and presented at INFORUM 2025: [Article___Deadlock_Freedom_in_FreeST.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/24866229/Article___Deadlock_Freedom_in_FreeST.pdf)

My dissertation was focused on the expansion of this mechanism into the polymorphic realm, and the code can be visited at https://github.com/freest-lang/freest3/tree/deadlock-freedom-poly. The document is the follwing: [Thesis___Deadlock_Freedom_in_FreeST.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/24866222/Thesis___Deadlock_Freedom_in_FreeST.pdf)

Following the submission of my dissertation, I worked on this project for 2 additional months to implement further developments. The resulting work is available at https://github.com/freest-lang/freest3/tree/deadlock-freedom-poly-dual.

Because I worked directly on FreeST's official repository, the resulting activity is missing from my profile.
